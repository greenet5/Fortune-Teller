console.log('Hello World');
/*
Plan:
This project will be built in JavaScript. 
The end goal is to build a fortune teller. 
When the user runs the program, it will output an initial message, something like "hmmmm, you're difficult to read". 
The next message to output will state the the outlook for the user, something like "things don't look good for you". 
The following message will state a short term fate for the user, something like "The next few days will be dark". 
The following message will output a long term fate for the user, something like "but you will live a very long and happy life".
The final message will be something like "Now shoo. Run along".
